# Basic_code

Welcome to the **Basic_code** repository. This repository contains a collection of my practice codes in **C**, **C++**, and **Java**. Each programming language is organized into its own folder:

- **C**: Contains basic programs and experiments with the fundamental concepts of C.
- **C++**: Includes programs related to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and other advanced C++ topics.
- **Contests**: This folder contains solutions to various programming contests and competitive programming problems.
- **Java**: A newly added folder where I explore **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and Java-specific features.

Feel free to explore and check out the different coding solutions and exercises Iâ€™m working on. More programs will be added as I continue my learning journey.
