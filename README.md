# Basic_code

Welcome to my **Basic_code** repository! ðŸŽ‰

Here, you'll find a collection of my basic practice codes in **C** and **C++**, organized neatly into two folders:

- A **C** folder, where I'm diving into the fundamentals of C and experimenting with different concepts.
- A **C++** folder, where I explore everything from **DSA**, **object-oriented programming**, to more **advanced concepts** that keep my coding journey exciting.

Got any cool coding challenges for me? ðŸ˜Ž Feel free to ask! Or just stay tuned as I continue to add more fun and interesting programs! ðŸš€

Happy coding! Let's make those bugs disappear. ðŸ’»âœ¨
